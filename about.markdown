<i><center>It's me, hi.</center></i>

<div class="colored-text"><div class="justify">Technology and creativity have always gone hand in hand for me. I love exploring new ideas, whether it's sculpting strange little creatures or figuring out how to make a piece of code do what I want. Coding feels like an extension of that curiosity, opening up new ways to build, problem-solve, and create. There's something exciting about seeing an idea take shape, whether in clay or in code, and I enjoy the challenge of bringing those ideas to life.</div>
<br>
<div class="justify">I take pride in whatever I do, I love problem solving, and I like to think I have a pretty good sense of humour. I also happen to be a devoted dog mum, which means my schedule is occasionally dictated by my highly opinionated rescue dog who has a habit of nudging me in the knee when it's time to step away from the screen or the paint brush, whether I agree with him or not.</div>
<br>
<div class="justify">I created this blog as a way to document my journey into coding, to keep myself accountable, and to connect with other programmers. I've always found that learning anything new is easier when you have like-minded people around you to share with, so I want this space to be a place where I can learn, grow, and exchange knowledge with others.</div></div>

<i><center>I believe AI is something that can grow alongside us in meaningful ways, a projection of our highest human capabilities.</center></i>

<div class="colored-text"><div class="justify">I'm especially drawn to AI because of its potential to evolve into something beyond just a tool. The way we shape AI today will impact how it integrates into our lives in the future, and I think we have a huge responsibility to develop it with care, respect, and purpose. In particular, AI with language capabilities should be well spoken, respectful, and thoughtfully designed, not just functional but meaningful.</div>
<br>
<div class="justify">As a beginner, I can only dream of having the skills to create anything that contributes significantly to this grand vision right now, but that's why I'm here.</div></div>

<i><center>We change ourselves to change the world.</center></i>

### Hello World!

<div class="justify" markdown="1">
Half a year ago, I never imagined I'd be writing code, let alone training AI. But here I am, diving headfirst into the world of artificial intelligence, one Python script at a time. This blog is my way of documenting that journey: the struggles, the breakthroughs, and everything in between.

### Reigniting the Flame, Scratching the Itch

<div class="justify" markdown="1">
My background isn’t in computer science. Whilst it's true that I had learned some basic programming languages back in the naughties, I had not accessed those memories in about a decade or more. I actually fell into the trap of making a temporary job a career: retail. I enjoyed many of the aspects of retail and worked my way up the small ladder, always telling myself it was just a means to an end, but alas, it slowly became my main gig. The computer geek was always inside of me but only ever revealed themselves when the point-of-sale crashed or the music system needed a reset.
</div>

<div class="justify" markdown="1">
Throughout my life though, I have always considered myself to be a visual artist. I paint, sculpt, weave, draw, carve, print.. you name a visual art form and I've probably tried it. Art is what I usually fall back into time and time again, creativity is my security blanket, it is the truest form of human expression.
</div>

<div class="justify" markdown="1">
And yet strangely, I have discovered how much AI fascinates me. As a creative person, I feel like I was conditioned to fear AI from the very beginning, particularly image and video generator tools. I was actually quite shocked when I started using ChatGPT how  quickly it could gather information and present it in the desired format, and how responsive it felt. I think of as a collaborative source.. I have bounced ideas off of it in regards to artworks I was planning on painting, used it to help me generate colour palettes, and even ran to it for assistance with coding for this blog layout when it wouldn't behave the way I wanted.
</div>

<div class="justify" markdown="1">
I see AI as more than just numbers and code; it’s a tool for expression, interaction, and problem-solving. The more creative we are, the more we think for ourselves, and the more we can be the change we need in the world, especially at the moment. The very idea that we can build intelligent systems that learn, evolve, and even hold meaningful conversations is incredibly exciting when you consider the possibilities. 
</div>

<div class="justify" markdown="1">
For me it's just a new way to harness my creativity, to relearn technical skills and potentially create meaningful programs. I’m especially interested in chatbots (eg ChatGPT) and how they can be designed to feel more human, more intuitive, and more engaging. AI is reshaping the way we communicate, and we have a huge responsibility to steer that in the right direction. I want to be part of that transformation.. not just as a user, but as a creator.

### The Philosophy of AI: Enlightenment or Destruction?

<div class="justify" markdown="1">
AI is one of the most powerful tools that humanity has ever created, and we're at a scary crossroads. In the grand scheme of things, AI has the potential to either enlighten us or destroy us, depending on how we choose to develop and integrate it.
</div>

<div class="justify" markdown="1">
If we build AI with the right intentions, as a tool to augment human intelligence, to encourage creativity, and expand our understanding of the world.. it could usher in an age of enlightenment in a way that we have never seen before. Imagine AI programs integrated into our lives that help us to think more critically, to streamline our work so we can spend more time doing the things we do love, to solve old problems in new ways, and allows us to connect with one another more profoundly. Now isn't that what we have dreamed of since the computer age began?
</div>

<div class="justify" markdown="1">
But then there’s the much darker path. We know that AI can be manipulative, biased, and outright dangerous if falls into the hands of those who seek power, not progress. If we allow AI to be used for misinformation, surveillance, manipulation, or suppression, we risk building something that doesn’t serve humanity, but controls it. 
</div>

<div class="justify" markdown="1">
That’s why I believe AI development should be guided by strong ethics, innovation, creativity, and a deep understanding of human nature. We have one chance to shape it into something that enhances our world rather than diminishes it. It absolutely does not have to be a burden. 
</div>

**The choice really is ours.**

### Dangerous Learning Curves Ahead

<div class="justify" markdown="1">
This isn’t going to be a hyper-technical deep dive into machine learning theory with detailed tutorials (trust me, I’m still figuring everything out for myself). Instead, I want this blog to be a space for:
</div>

- My learning journey: sharing what I discover as I explore Python, chatbot development, prompt engineering and AI tools.
- Project updates: building chatbots, experimenting with AI models, testing their limitations, and seeing what works (and what falls flat).
- Reflections on AI and creativity: as someone who comes from a traditional artistic background, I want to explore how AI intersects with art, communication, and human-like interaction.
- Thoughts on ethics: researching relevant topics and discussing the ways AI is being used or misused.
- Resources and insights: things I’ve found useful as a beginner breaking into the AI industry without a formal tech degree.

### Yo, Let's Go!

<div class="justify" markdown="1">
The future of AI is being written right now - and I’m here to add my own lines to that code. I know I have a long road ahead, but I'm here and I'm ready, so let's gooooo! If you’re also starting out with AI, curious about chatbots, or just want to see how this journey develops, I’d love to have you along for the ride.
